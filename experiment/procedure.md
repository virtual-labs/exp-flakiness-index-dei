### Procedure

1. Take about a minimum number of 200 pieces of aggregate of any
fraction.
2. Sieve the sample through IS specified sieves.
3. For separation of flaky material, each fraction of aggregate shall be
gauged on a thickness gauge to determine the thickness.
4. Weigh the total amount of flaky material that has passed the thickness
gauge to an accuracy of 0.1 % of the weight of the sample.
5. Flakiness index is then calculated by expressing the total weight of
material passing the thickness gauge as a percentage of the total weight of
the sample gauged.
