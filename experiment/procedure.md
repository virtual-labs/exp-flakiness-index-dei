### Procedure


Step 1: Objective and Apparatus  
To determine the flakiness index of coarse aggregates.  

Apparatus used: sieve shaker, flakiness index gauge, aggregates, sieves of sizes 25 mm, 20 mm, 16 mm, 12.5 mm, 10 mm, and a pan.  

Click the Next Step button.

Step 2: Assemble Sieves and Sieving  
- Assemble the sieves in descending order with the largest aperture sieve at the top and the smallest at the bottom.  
- Place a pan below the bottommost sieve.  
- Pour the aggregates into the sieve stack.  
- Cover the sieve stack with a lid and place it on the sieve shaker.  
- Start the sieve shaker and wait for the sieving process to complete.  
- Click the Next Step button.

Step 3: Test 20 mm Fraction  
- Take aggregates retained on the 20 mm sieve.  
- Pass each aggregate through the 25–20 mm slot of the flakiness gauge.  
- Separate aggregates that pass through the gauge from those that do not.  
- Click the Next Step button.

Step 4: Test 16 mm Fraction  
- Take aggregates retained on the 16 mm sieve.  
- Pass them through the 20–16 mm slot of the flakiness gauge.  
- Separate passing and non-passing aggregates.  
- Click the Next Step button.

Step 5: Test 12.5 mm Fraction  
- Take aggregates retained on the 12.5 mm sieve.  
- Pass them through the 16–12.5 mm slot of the flakiness gauge.  
- Click the Next Step button.

Step 6: Test 10 mm Fraction  
- Take aggregates retained on the 10 mm sieve.  
- Pass them through the 12.5–10 mm slot of the flakiness gauge.  
- Click the Next Step button.

Step 7: Test 6.3 mm Fraction  
- Take aggregates retained on the 6.3 mm sieve.  
- Pass them through the 10–6.3 mm slot of the flakiness gauge.  
- Click the Next Step button.

Step 8: Results 
- Click First Sample Reading.  
- Click Second Sample Reading.  
- Click Third Sample Reading.  
- Click Fourth Sample Reading. 
- Click Fifth Sample Reading.
- Click to calculate Flakiness Index.
